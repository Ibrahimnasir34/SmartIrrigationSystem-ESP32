# SmartIrrigationSystem-ESP32
The project utilizes a combination of soil moisture sensors, weather data, and the ESP32 microcontroller to monitor and control the irrigation process dynamically. By adjusting watering schedules based on real-time conditions, the system ensures that plants receive adequate moisture without wasteful over-irrigation.
